# Mauro Spivak's chess simulator

## Introduction

Hey there! Thanks for taking the time to read this and check my app. For any comments, questions or suggestions, don't hesitate on dropping me a few lines to mauros@gmail.com

## Coding Standards and Conducts

I try to stick to [PHP Standards Recommendations](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/) as much as I can. 

Also, rather than using (too many) comments in my code, I try to write â€“where applicable-, code that's understandable by itself without the need of comments.
